  <description>1.19.0.2 (10-02-2018)

  Adds Werewolves to RimWorld.

  Quick Werewolf Guide
  1) Find a character with the Werewolf trait.
  2) Werewolves will unlock their first transformation during a full moon.
  3) When a Werewolf has transformed at least one time, it is called a blooded werewolf, and blooded Werewolves can learn more forms with Full Moon Fury enabled (next to the Draft button) during future full moons.

  Werewolf Forms
  -&gt; Glabro - Near Man
  -&gt; Crinos - Battle Form Werewolf
  -&gt; Hispo  - Near Wolf
  -&gt; Lupus  - Wolf Form
  -&gt; ?????  - Secret
